Data-Structures
==============

This is a project Harris Lee and I worked on while enrolled at Hack Reactor. It has various data structures implemented in Javascript.

## Data structures:

- Stack
- Queue
- HashTable
- LinkedList
- DoublyLinkedList
- Tree
- BinarySearchTree
- Graph
- Set

### Testing

The test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the tests, just open the spec runner file with a browser. The tests are built with [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
